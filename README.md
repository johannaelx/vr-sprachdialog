# VR/AR Speech Dialogue Prototype

A VR-based learning prototype that integrates open-source AI speech models to enable natural spoken dialogue inside immersive environments. The project explores how real-time voice interaction can support language learning in everyday scenarios such as a bakery, doctor’s visit, or ticket counter.

## Features

- Real-time speech pipeline: **ASR (Whisper)** → **LLM (LLaMA/Mistral)** → **TTS (Piper)**
- Interactive VR scenes built with **Unity**
- Natural spoken conversations with NPCs
- Optional subtitles and multiple difficulty levels (A1–B2)

## Project Goal

Create an immersive, playful VR training experience where users practice authentic conversations and gain confidence speaking a foreign language.
